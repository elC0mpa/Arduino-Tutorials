# Arduino bases
The main goal of this repository is **to teach the key concepts of microcontrollers**, using as example the well known
platform Arduino.  
These will be the topics:  
* Digital inputs  
	* Digital Read  
	* Hardware Interrupts  
* TimingEvents  
	* Delay  
	* Timers Reading (millis)  
	* Timers Interrupts
